I am Naveed Riaziat, a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student at the Johns Hopkins University HAMR Lab. My research interests include robotic minimally invasive surgery, haptics, and all things medicine. In my (sparse) free time, I dabble in landscape and portrait photography, playing basketball, and pretending to know a lot about espresso. 

Before coming to Baltimore, I grew up in the SF bay area. I was an avid roboticist in high school and continued to study robotics and controls at Purdue University in Indiana. After a summer internship with Intuitive Surgical, a long time dream of mine, I was inspired to pursue my Ph.D. and continue exploring the forefront of robotics and medicine. 

I am always excited to talk to anyone interested about my work or my hobbies so don't hesitate to contact me here or on LinkedIn!
